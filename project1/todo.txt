1. Add new modal that utilises markers
    - Example is earthquakes from geonames that places a marker for each earthquake found in a given area.
        - This could then be clickable to provide info about the earthquake
        - Could do this as well as a second, static modal.

2. Set location to the user's location when page is loaded.
    - This would simply call the same function as when a country is selected when the page is initially loaded
    - Find a tool that can access the user's current location and use the jQuery .onLoad() method
